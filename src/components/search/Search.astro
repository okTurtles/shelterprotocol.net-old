  NOTE: Why not using 'Search.tsx' directly in 'astro.config.mjs'?

  The Search component was implemented as a react component in the first place and
  in order for its interactivity to work properly, 'client:*' directive must be specified on it.
  So, we are wrapping it as a .astro component here.
